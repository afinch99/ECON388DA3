# ECON388DA3

This repository contains relevant files for my ECON 388 project. 
2020_2021_HPI_with_FIPS.csv contains HPI data found on the fhfa website. 
County_Level_Population_2020.csv contains population data from the 2020 U.S. Census
County_Level_population_2020.dta contains the same data, but is formatted as a dta for easy STATA access. 
NYT_Deaths_bycountyfips.dta contains COVID data from the New York Times. The csv file with the same data was too large to upload to GitHub, but this dta file contains the same exact data and can be easily exported as a csv. 
FinalDataSetMerged.dta is the compilation of the 3 data sets in dta format. 
AdamFinchDA3.do is my STATA do file that can be used to duplicate my work. 
log_DA3.smcl is the log that tracked all of my STATA activity.
